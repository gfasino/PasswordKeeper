## What's the difference between encrypted/uncrypted export?
Unencrypted are simple text files where each line is written to one of the fields (service-username-password). This import method has been implemented to allow a user to write their passwords from your PC without using external software and then insert them in the application. In this e-mail i am attaching an example so that you have a clear structure of the file.
The encrypted files can only be generated by my application via the export option. All the contents of the application's database is encrypted with a password (which you will be required during the export) and saved them to txt file. 

## Where I can find the exported file?

The export should take place in the SD card (it depends on the device you' re using and it's settings), you should look for a folder named PasswordKeeper.

## I forgot my password, can you recover my data?
No, I can't.

## The export function do not work, what can I do?
unfortunately with recent Android updates some files' features no longer work.
If you can still access to the app you can revoer them manually.
